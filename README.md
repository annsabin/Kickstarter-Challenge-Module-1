# Kickstarter-Challenge-Module-1
Excel spreadsheet analysis using formulas, pivot tables, and visualizations.

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of this project was to ensure students extract insights from datasets in Excel spreadsheets using formulas and visualize results. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

A review of failed, successful and canceled theater projects between 2014 and 2016 show the months of May and June have the highest rate of success. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Analysis of outcomes based on goals shows that chances of failure increase as the dollar amount goal goes up. By contrast, chances of success are highest when goals are set at less than $1000. 

The highest chance of failure occurs when goals are set at +$45000. Nevertheless, data also shows an approximate 60% chance to succeed for goals set between $35000 and $45000. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Everything in this exercise was a challenge because I can't remember formulas/syntax and having to look them up online (with examples) made the task longer than I would have liked. However, I learned how powerful these excel tools can be. With practice, this type of work will be fun and faster to do. 

## Results

### Conclusions based on Outcomes and Launch Dates

The months of May and June showed both the highest number of successful projects for the year and a higher percentage of success v. failure (~65% success and ~31% failure). By contrast, the month of December had the highest failure rate, with 49% of projects succeeding and 46% percent of projects failing. 

### Conclusions based on goals

Goals above $45000 should be reconsidered given their near 100% chance to fail. To maximize chances of success, goals should focus on campaigns aiming for  $1000 to $450000. Based on previous records, the goals most likely to succeed will be in two ranges: one under $1000 and one between $35-45000. 

### Dataset limitations

The timeframe is dated (2014-2016). If the analysis is intended for decisionmaking in 2022 (post-COVID), health considerations and changes in disposable income amid rapid inflation in 2021-2 may influence different consumer spending behavior/preferences compared to 2014-6. 

Another limitation is not having more variables to explore causes of failure. While timing and financial targets most likely contribute to project success or failure, other factors such as appeal of the project on target audiences (if any) likely play a role as well.  

### Other possible tables and/or graphs 

This dataset would allow us to compare outcomes across categories/sub-categories and countries.
